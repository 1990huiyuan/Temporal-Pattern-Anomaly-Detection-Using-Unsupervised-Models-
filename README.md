# Temporal-Pattern-Anomaly-Detection-Using-Unsupervised-Models-
The purpose is to find the years with special phosphorus temporal patterns and what make them different from other years. This analysis 
involved with multiple unsupervised models, including time series k-means and hierarchical clustering. 
The similar analysis is also done on chlorophyll-a concentration, which is an important indicator of eutrophication.
The conditions of phosphorus loading that could cause potential high eutrophication possibilities are built based on this analysis.
